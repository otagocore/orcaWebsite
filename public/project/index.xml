      <description>Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger The Geotek MSCL situated at ORCA is an instrument for gathering data in an automated and quality-controlled way. The parameters that can be measured are
 P-wave velocity; Gamma density; Magnetic susceptibility using both loop and point sensors; Electrical resistivity; Colour linescan imaging including RGB data at sub-millimeter resolution Colour spectrophotometry  Measurements are typically made at a 5mm Resolution with the exception of the loop magnetic susceptibility on whole cores which is measured at a 20mm Resolution.</description>

      <description>The Cox Analytical Systems iTrax XRF Corescanner can be used to obtain high resolution geochemical and image data from split drill cores, wet sediments and discrete samples. The itrax has the ability to measure core diameters between 60 and 120mm at resolutions that can range between a minimum of 0.1 mm and a maximum of 10 mm.
The iTrax has the ability to
 measure multiple elements between Al and U in a single run, generally down to ppm levels for most metals.</description>
