<h1>Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger</h1>



<p>The Geotek MSCL situated at ORCA is an instrument for gathering data in an automated and quality-controlled way. The parameters that can be measured are</p>
<ul>
<li>P-wave velocity;</li>
<li>Gamma density;</li>
<li>Magnetic susceptibility using both loop and point sensors;</li>
<li>Electrical resistivity;</li>
<li>Colour linescan imaging including RGB data at sub-millimeter resolution</li>
<li>Colour spectrophotometry</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/Geotek/mscl.jpg" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>Measurements are typically made at a 5mm Resolution with the exception of the loop magnetic susceptibility on whole cores which is measured at a 20mm Resolution. Measurement times at these resolutions are</p>
<ul>
<li>Whole Core - 1 meter of core takes approximately 1 hour</li>
<li>Split Core - 1 meter of core takes approximately 1.5 hours</li>
<li>Line scan imaging - 1m of core takes approximately 20 mins, depending on the exposure time selected</li>
</ul>
<p>The MSCL is able to analyse either whole or split core between 50 and 150mm in diameter, cut into sections up to 1.5 m long.</p>
