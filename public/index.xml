      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at installing hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <title>Migrate from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger The Geotek MSCL situated at ORCA is an instrument for gathering data in an automated and quality-controlled way. The parameters that can be measured are
 P-wave velocity; Gamma density; Magnetic susceptibility using both loop and point sensors; Electrical resistivity; Colour linescan imaging including RGB data at sub-millimeter resolution Colour spectrophotometry  Measurements are typically made at a 5mm Resolution with the exception of the loop magnetic susceptibility on whole cores which is measured at a 20mm Resolution.</description>

      <description>The Cox Analytical Systems iTrax XRF Corescanner can be used to obtain high resolution geochemical and image data from split drill cores, wet sediments and discrete samples. The itrax has the ability to measure core diameters between 60 and 120mm at resolutions that can range between a minimum of 0.1 mm and a maximum of 10 mm.
The iTrax has the ability to
 measure multiple elements between Al and U in a single run, generally down to ppm levels for most metals.</description>
